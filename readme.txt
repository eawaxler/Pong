Welcome to Pong!

This version of Pong for the Game Boy Advanced is for 2 players.
Player 1 will control the left paddle using the UP button to slide their
paddle up and the DOWN button to slide it down.
Player 2's paddle will be operated using the A button to slide up and B
to slide down. 

The ball will bounce from left to right. Be sure to hit the ball with 
your paddle when it comes your way or else your opponent will score a 
point! Points are totaled towards the top of the screen on each respective
side. 

When a point is scored, the ball will restart in the center of the screen
and move in the direction of whoever scored the last point. 

The first player to score 3 points will win. In order to restart the 
game and play again, press the R button. Good luck!
